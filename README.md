# Redux Shopping Cart Example With Added Functionality

This is a fork of the [redux shopping cart](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/tree/master/examples/shopping-cart) with the added functionality of [reactabular](https://github.com/reactabular/reactabular) and the ability to remove items from your cart prior to checking out, and the ability to see previous checkout transactions via the overall receipt view and the detailed receipt view.

This project template was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), which provides a simple way to start React projects with no build configuration needed.

Projects built with Create-React-App include support for ES6 syntax, as well as several unofficial / not-yet-final forms of Javascript syntax such as Class Properties and JSX.  See the list of [language features and polyfills supported by Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#supported-language-features-and-polyfills) for more information.
